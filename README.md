# Sequence Alignment Algorithms

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/malvikasharan/Alignment-Algorithms/master)

- Sequence alignment algorithms are ways to **arrange two or many biological sequences** 
- They **identify regions of similarity** that may indicate to functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

The This repo consist of a demo file and related coduments to explain protein sequence, alignment algoriths to work with them and their relevance in bioinformatics.

**Demo file**

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/malvikasharan/Alignment-Algorithms/blob/master/homage_to_alignment%20algorithms.ipynb)
  - Access them on [NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/malvikasharan/Alignment-Algorithms/blob/master/homage_to_alignment%20algorithms.ipynb) and Binder: [https://gke.mybinder.org/v2/gh/malvikasharan/Alignment-Algorithms/master](https://gke.mybinder.org/v2/gh/malvikasharan/Alignment-Algorithms/master).
