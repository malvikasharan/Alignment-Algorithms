# Sequence Alignment Algorithms

- Sequence alignment algorithms are ways to **arrange two or many biological sequences** 
- They **identify regions of similarity** that may indicate to functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

The This repo consist of a demo file and related coduments to explain protein sequence, alignment algoriths to work with them and their relevance in bioinformatics.
